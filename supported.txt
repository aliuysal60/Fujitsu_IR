This functionality mirrors that of many Fujitsu remotes, but I've confirmed by testing codes on the following remotes:

Fujitsu AR-REG1U


I've tested the codes against the following Fujitsu indoor units:

ASU7RLF1





The following functions are implemented:

-Heat mode, auto fan speed, temperatures 60F through 88F, in two degree increments.
